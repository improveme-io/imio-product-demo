                Reuven I. Kristof Gatter builds digital products from the
                initial brainstorming phase to the final UI design. He takes a
                holistic approach to his work, adjusting his role according to
                the project&apos;s needs. Although he is primarily a designer,
                Kristof has gained considerable experience in mentoring,
                facilitating workshops, conducting usability tests, and teaching
                about different aspects of making digital products.
                <br />
                <br />
                He became interested in Feedback and the HR Software space
                during his tenure at Small Improvements. After having a great
                experience with peer feedback, he never quite managed to have
                proper continious feedback at other startups which has lead him
                to start improveme.io, where feedback can be facilitated without
                management overhead.
                <br />
                <br />
                Kristof also taught digital design courses at various
                institutions, including MOME, a design university in Budapest,
                the University of Arts Berlin, and the Startup Institute.
