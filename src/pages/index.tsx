                Reuven I. Kristof Gatter builds digital products from the
                initial brainstorming phase to the final UI design. He takes a
                holistic approach to his work, adjusting his role according to
                the project&apos;s needs. Although he is primarily a designer,
                Kristof has gained considerable experience in mentoring,
                facilitating workshops, conducting usability tests, and teaching
                about different aspects of making digital products.
                <br />
                <br />
                He became interested in Feedback and the HR Software space
                during his tenure at Small Improvements. After having a great
                experience with peer feedback, he never quite managed to have
                proper continious feedback at other startups which has lead him
                to start improveme.io, where feedback can be facilitated without
                management overhead.
                <br />
                <br />
                Kristof also taught digital design courses at various
                institutions, including MOME, a design university in Budapest,
                the University of Arts Berlin, and the Startup Institute.

                Mihaly FÃ¼redi was born in Boston but resides in Budapest. He is

                He started his career as a customer support agent at Prezi where
                he fell in love with the product and decided to become an
                engineer. While picking up calls during a night shift phone
                support job, he finished a bootcamp-style coding school during
                the day. This enabled him to advance to a full-stack engineering
                position that focused on automation and tooling for Prezi&apos;s
                go-to-market teams. After 4 years, he wanted to explore the
                freelance space where he worked both as a frontend engineer and
                as a product owner & scrum master and finally ended up working
                for various startups in Germany and Austria.
